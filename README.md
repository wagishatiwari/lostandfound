## Skill set used

- Java 21
- SpringBoot
- POSTGRES Database
- Liquibase
- Testcontainers
- Docker
- Test Driven Development (TDD)

## How to run locally

Since this project uses the postgres instance to support our operations.

- 1. Need to start the postgres instance on your local.

> start the docker instance of the POSTGRES in the docker-compose file provided in the path
> docker-compose.yml (starts instance in port 9001) --> localhost:9001

> to verify: use your local database GUI (DBeaver, SQL Developer)<br/>
> DB URL: "jdbc:postgresql://localhost:5432/db-lost-and-found" <br/>
> DB USER: "lafdbuser"<br/>
> DB PASSWORD: "lafdbpassword"<br/>

- 2. Liquibase Migrations

Liquibase allows you to specify the database change you want using SQL or several different database-agnostic formats,
including XML, YAML, and JSON. Developers can abstract the database code to make it extremely easy to push out changes
to different database types.

Liquibase script will run as part of the application startup, which will create the database and the required tables.

- 3. Start the application locally using the command
> mvn spring-boot:run

by running the above script creates the actual DB changes defined in src/main/resources/db/changelog is replicated in the dockerized
postgres instance that is created.

- 4. Mock Data
  User_details table have been prepared with the following data from the liquibase script.
  ```
  src/main/resources/db/changelog/changes/data/user-details.csv


## WE ARE READY?

let's start the microservice project, so by default it will start on the port localhost:8081 now!
